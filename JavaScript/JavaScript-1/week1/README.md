### 1. Write a console.log statement saying "Hello World!" for each language that you know.

  - For example:
    ```Javascript
      Halo, dunia! // Indonesian
      Ciao, mondo! // Italian
      Hola, mundo! // Spanish
      ```


### 2. Consider the following code:

  `console.log('I'm awesome');`

  Copy the code in your .js file and run it. You will see that you will get a SyntaxError. Find a solution for this error. Hint: read the error message carefully, it also gives an indication of where the problem is.


### 3. Declare a variable x and initialize it with an integer, using these exact steps:
  - 3.1 First, declare your variable x (do not initialize it yet).
  - 3.2 Add a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of x is, like in this example:

    ```Javascript
      // TODO -> here you initialize your variable
      console.log('the value of my variable x will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');
      ```
  - 3.3 Add a console.log statement that logs the value of x.
  - 3.4 Now initialize your variable x with an integer.
  - 3.5 Next, add a console.log statement that explains what you think the value of x is.
  - 3.6 Add a console.log statement that logs the value of x.
    Steps to be taken:

    ```Javascript
      // TODO -> here you declare your variable
      console.log('the value of x will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');
      // TODO -> log the actual value of x
      // TODO -> here you initialize your variable
      console.log('the value of x will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');
      // TODO -> log value of x again
    ```
### 4. Declare a variable y and assign a string to it.
  - 4.1 Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.
  - 4.2 Now console.log the variable y.
  - 4.3 Now assign a new string to the variable y.
  - 4.4 Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.
  - 4.5 Now console.log y again.

    ```Javascript
      // TODO -> here you declare AND assign your string
      console.log('the value of my string will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');
      // TODO -> log the actual value of the string to the console
      // TODO -> assign a new value to your variable x
      console.log('the value of my string will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');
      // TODO -> log the actual value of the string to the console
    ```
### 5. How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer (i.e., whole number)?
  - 5.1 Declare a variable z and assign the number 7.25 to it.
  - 5.2 console.log z.
  - 5.3 Declare another variable a that has the value of z but rounded to the nearest integer.
  - 5.4 console.log a.
  - 5.5 So now we have z and a find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable.
  - 5.6 console.log the highest value.

### 6. Arrays
  - 6.1 Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of containing more than one element. (See Naming conventions).
  - 6.2 Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
  - 6.3 console.log your array.
  - 6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).
  - 6.5 Log your array.
  - 6.6 Add a statement that adds Daan's favorite animal ('baby pig') to the existing array.
  - 6.7 Log your new array!

### 7. More strings
  Let's consider the following string: let myString = "this is a test".
  - 7.1 Add the string to your file and console.log it.
  - 7.2 Find a way to get the length of myString.
  - 7.3 console.log the length of myString.

### 8. Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type.
  - 8.1 First declare at least four variables and assign them different data types.
  - 8.2 For each variable write a console.log statement that logs the value
    ```Javascript
      let foo = 3;
      console.log('The value of my variable foo is: ' + foo);
      (Curious to know what a foo is? Check this article on Wikipedia.)
    ```

  - 8.3 Now write a console.log statement wherein you first explain in words what you think the type of your variables is.
  - 8.4 Now use typeof to log the actual type of your variables.
  - 8.5 Now compare the types of your different variables with one another.
  - 8.6 Make sure to also show a message when the variables you are comparing are not the same type.

    For example:
    ```Javascript
    let x = 9;
    let y = 'Hello';

    if (...) {
        console.log('SAME TYPE');
    }
    // TODO -> add a way of giving feedback if your variables don't have the same type
    ```

### 9. If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the new value of x?
  - 9.1 Add at least 3 console.log statements in which you show that you understand what % does.

### 10. Write a program to answer the following questions:
  - 10.1 Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings? Make an example that illustrates your answer.
  - 10.2 Can you compare infinities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this?
  - 10.3 Add console.log statements to the above program in which you show that you understand the concepts (just like you've done in the above assignments).
