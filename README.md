# About me
I joined HackYourFuture Copenhagen on June 10th. Before the class I learned HTML/CSS/JS/git basics; parallelly to this code school, I'm also reading EloquentJS and taking some other courses to improve and compensate the fact that I do not have a tech background and I was not exposed to code before.
