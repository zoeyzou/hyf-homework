# HomeWork1

Today is Sunday and you ask your friend in how many days you are meeting. If the friend says
I will see you in 9 days. The output should be Tuesday.

You should get the today's day from the system.

So typical console output is:

Today is: Sunday 
How many days to meet : 9
We are meeting on : Tuesday

Hint: ask each other for help/ask the right questions to the mentors.

(Challenge - only do this one once you have finished 1 and 2). Please work closely with your pair we identified in class.

I would strongly recommend play the game couple of times and adjust the step below if 
necessary. See also the flow chart we gave you.

1. Create an object of card
2. Create an object of player with the following : name, age, winner
3. Create an object for game with the following variables: array of four players and four arrays of cards.
4. Each array belongs to one player.
5. Create a function to distribute the cards to the four arrays.
6. Take the next player in the array. 
7. Find cards with highest frequency.
8. Go to the next player and see if the player has the card you want
9. If it does continue and go to 7. If not go to 6.
10. If at any point there is one happy family in one of the array change the winner key to "true" declare winner.
