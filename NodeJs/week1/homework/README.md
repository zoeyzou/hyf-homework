*1)* The first challenge consist to find hoe many times a word is found in a 4 different documents. So u need to read 4 files and find how many times a word is repeated in those 4 files. The software as fast as possible and as short as possible :slightly_smiling_face: .

Bonus point: Try to see how much time will take to run your code.

*2)* Repeat the challenge without use any async code (like Roith did in the end of the class) and see how fast it is

*3)* There's a file index.js. To make it run successfully, you need to improve the class Person which should provide the methods required below.
